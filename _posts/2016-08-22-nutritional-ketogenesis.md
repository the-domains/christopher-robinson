# Nutritional Ketogenesis

Maybe you've seen me not eat anything at an event, or otherwise seen me being finicky about what foods I eat. It's not because I don't like the cooking, or object to the company; but rather, due to a somewhat complex diet discipline.

I adhere to a **nutritional ketogenic** diet: this essentially means that healthy fats make around 75-80% of my daily food intake with protein falling in around 15-20% and a goal of avoiding all forms of carbs (fructose, sugars, breads, starches) except for fibrous greens.

I can pretty much eat as much butter, olive oil, bacon, bacon grease, cheese, heavy cream, and salt as I want: all the tasty stuff!

**You may be asking "why?"**

The benefits I experience include:

* Seldom have that hungry re-feeding feeling
* Even if I wake up and do not eat, I have energy until about 4pm (intermittent fasting helps the body)
* Strong mental focus (no cloudiness or foggy brain)
* High-sustainable energy
* Stronger endurance
* Fewer allergies

Nutritional Ketogenesis requires a switch-over phase (most intensely for the first two weeks, but continues to keto adapt for about two years) where the glycogen stores (in the liver and muscle tissue cells) are depleted and thereafter restricted, and where the body systems are triggered to get fuel energy from digested fats that are then turned into mighty ketones.

It takes a lot of research to learn what would work best for you. Here are resources that helped me...

<article style=""><h1>The Ketogenic Diet for Health</h1><p>Keto-adaptation is the process of shifting your metabolism from relying mostly on glucose for fuel, to relying mostly on fat-based sources of fuel. Not only does fat oxidation itself increase, but your body starts producing enough ketones that they can be used as a significant source of fuel as well.</p></article>
